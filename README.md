Learning Java with Robots
=========================

This project, and the accompanying documentation is designed for high
school freshmen and middle school students who are interested in
learning the Java programming language so that they can eventually
participate in a FIRST Robotic Competition.

This project will *not* teach enterprise-level Java (and currently,
does not teach the RoboRIO's Java-specific library, WPI). This will
help to teach how to write *robotic* state machines, and have it run
an automated fashion on a game field, rendered in a top-down,
two-dimensional graphical frame.
