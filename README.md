Let's make some robotic state machines, and have it run an automated
course similar to last year's Bunnybot project.

In this game, a robot will need to look around and find a ball. When
it does, it goes over to it, picks it up, and carries it to one side
of the field (the end zone).

Right now, its behavior and actions are displayed with messages in the
console, but we should probably make a nice top-down graphical view of
the game...but let's do that later.
