title: Installing FRC's Robotic Library
---
After you have [learned Java][020], we'll show you how to program
actual robots using [FRC Robotic Library][wpilib]. Since you won't
need that library just to learn Java, you can skip this section that
shows you how to get that library and install it later.

These instructions assume you've [installed Java][011],
and [installed Eclipse][012].

  1. Start Eclipse, and select **Install New Software** from the
     **Help** menu:

  2. Click the **Add** button to add a new location where we can get goodies:

     Enter the following:

     - Name :: FRC Plugins (this, you can call it anything you'd like)
     - Location :: http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/eclipse/

     Click **OK**

  3. Select the **Robot Java Development** module, and click **Next**:

  4. After this is installed, go to the **Workbench**:

At this point in our [getting started guide][010], you should have
everything installed, start [learning Java][020]!
