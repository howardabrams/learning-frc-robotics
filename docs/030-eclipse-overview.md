title: Getting to Know Eclipse
---
Eclipse is a general-purpose programming environment that you can
extend easily with plugins. To follow this page, you need
to [follow the instructions in Installing Eclipse][012].

The following is what I think are the minimal amount of skills you
should know to be effective. Over time, you'll learn more of the
features and more of the shortcuts. If you learn something useful,
feel free to edit this page and add it...especially if you find
introductory videos that might help.

Workbench Concepts
======================================================================

The workbench is the graphical user interface of mini-windows and
things. The first thing to notice is that you can drag the
mini-windows (called views any where you'd like to change the layout).

* View :: A mini-window or panel that does something.
  * Go to **Window > Show** View to open new panels
  * Views can be dragged around the screen to either be added next to
    something (like a tab) or to define a whole new screen section.

* Controls :: controls a view panel, including:
  * Closing or moving
  * Minimizing makes it transient
  * Maximizing
  * Restoring

* Perspective :: Layout organization for a purpose. For instance,
  switch to the Java perspective for editing Java code, but change to
  Java Debug when debugging your code.
