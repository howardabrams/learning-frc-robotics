Hi there. Interested in joining the robotics team as a programmer?
Great! The skills you learn here will carry you to learning other
computer languages and building other projects, like smart phone and
web applications.

Our team chooses to program our robots with Java, and if you youâ€™ve
learned how to program with other languages, perhaps I should explain
a little bit about how Java is different than other languages, and a
bit about us.

What do FRC Teams Do?
---------------------

As part of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), we design and build
robotics to compete against other high schools in obstacle course and
unique games.

During the first few seconds of every game, our robot executes in
*autonomous mode* where the robot can try to score without human
interaction. This is where our programming teams shine!

While each FRC team has many *sub-teams* and positions with different
strengths and capabilities, many students feel they should be able to
help out with the programming features first, then either continue to
program stronger features (like *vision tracking*), or try their hand
at CAD, assembly or strategy.

This course is designed to make you helpful early in the process.

What to Learn
-------------

Every member of the programming team should:

 * Know the Basics of the [Java Programming language][20]
 * Should know how to write code using an editor, like Eclipse
 * Know how to write tests to verify code
 * Know how to create code snapshots using Git (these snapshots are called "commits")
 * Know how to share code through Github
 * Learn what it takes to be a good programmer (this section would include both technical chops as well as ways of resolving inter-person conflict over code)
