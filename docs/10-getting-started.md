Interested in joining the robotics team as a programmer? Great! 

The skills you learn here will carry you to learning other computer languages and building other projects, like smart phone and web applications.

A Member of any programming team should be able to do the following:

* Know the Basics of the Java Programming language
* Should know how to write code [using an editor][11], like Eclipse
* Know how to [write tests to verify code][12]
* Know how to create code snapshots using Git (these snapshots are called "commits")
* Know how to share code through Github
* Learn what it takes to be a good programmer (this section would include both technical chops as well as ways of resolving inter-person conflict over code)
