title: Installing Eclipse

[Eclipse][eclipse] is an application to help us program Java. Most
of our "work" begins with starting this.

**Note:** These steps assume that you have already downloaded and
[installed Java][011].

Install Eclipse Neon
---------------------

First step is to point your web browser to [www.eclipse.org][eclipse]:

Then, finally:

You should now have an *archive file* for a version of Eclipse for
your computer's operating system.

Open the Downloaded File
------------------------

We now *extract* the archive file we just downloaded.
Double click should extract the contents and show you
an application for installing Eclipse:

   **Note:** If this doesn't work, please see the installation
   instructions on the [Eclipse web site][eclipse].

Double-click on the installer application to show you an installation choice.
Select **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers**:

Follow the rest of the Dialogs (you can choose the defaults).

---------------

Now that you have our development environment, Eclipse, installed,
next [download our source code project][013] we used for this site.
