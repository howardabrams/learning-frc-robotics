There are many ways to get started learning to code. The lessons on
this require you to have access to a personal computer (Windows, Mac
or Linux-based) where you can install some applications.

The following instructions explain how to get everything you need
installed and ready to learn. This includes Java, Eclipse and some
sample code that goes along with this site. Everything we need is free
and open source.

**Warning:** Our world changes quite quickly, and instructions like
these on the Internet often get out-dated. The following steps are
great for the year 2017, but may not be exactly correct later (yes, I
plan to keep this updated, but if I forget, let me know). Feel free
follow other instructions for getting Java and Eclipse running on your
system.

Getting Started Steps:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. [Install Java][011]
  2. [Install Eclipse][012]
  3. [Download our Source Code Project][013]
  4. [Installing FRC's Robotic Library][015] (optional)

After getting everything installed, start [learning Java][020]!
