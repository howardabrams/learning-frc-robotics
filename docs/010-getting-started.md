Interested in joining the robotics team as a programmer? Great! 

The skills you learn here will carry you to learning other computer 
languages and building other projects, like smart phone and web 
applications.

A Member of any programming team should be able to do the following:

* Know the Basics of the Java Programming language
* Should know how to write code [using an editor][011], like Eclipse
* Know how to [write tests to verify code][013]
* Know how to create code snapshots using Git (these snapshots are 
called "commits")
* Know how to share code through Github
* Learn what it takes to be a good programmer (this section would 
include both technical chops as well as ways of resolving inter-person 
conflict over code)
